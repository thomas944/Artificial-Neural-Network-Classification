Artifical Neural Network Classification of Iris CSV Dataset

Link for data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris

This is the implementation of neural networks for various activation functions without using neural network creation libraries
Libraries Used: pandas 1.5.3, matplotlib 3.6.3, numpy 1.24.2, scikit-learn 1.2.2, seaborn 0.12.2, time

Assumptions:
  1. Python 3.9.6 installed
  2. IDE installed (VS Code is recommended)
  3. Pip 23.0.1 installed
To Run Code:
  1. Navigate to file in IDE after downloading
  2. Install the necessary libraries
  3. Make sure you are in the right directory. Change directory by typing cd then the directory name 
  4. Once you are in the the right directory, type python part2.py to run code.
  5. Change parameters to see different activation function graphs, learning rates, use optimization, etc...
  6. Uncomment code at the bottom to see comparisons. There is a template provided. Comment the first section in main before running.
